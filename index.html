                    <p>For those of us who want to say thank you to our moms, it’s not always easy to put those big
                        feelings in words. Which is where Dribbble comes in.These eight shots crystallize the hard work
                        moms put into keeping their kids alive, happy, and healthy. They might give you the inspiration
                        you need for filling out that card—or stand alone for your mom’s interpretation.Moms are the
                        ones who bandage our boo-boos when we’re little and continue to take care of us as we get
                        older—often sacrificing their own needs so they can help with ours. Cruising on a bike to help
                        heal our injuries is the most mom thing one can do.Moms are the ones who bandage our boo-boos

                        thing one can do.They’re the ones we rely on for playdates and emotional support, homework help
                        and babysitting. Moms are the ultimate dependable support. Like, hopefully, the button on your
                        jeans.</p>
                    <h2>Here come the moms in space</h2>
                    <p>Moms are like…buttons? Moms are like glue. Moms are like pizza crusts. Moms are the ones who make
                        sure things happen—from birth to school lunch.
                        They’re the ones we rely on for playdates and emotional support, homework help and babysitting.

                        My hero when I was a kid was my mom. Same for everyone I knew. Moms are untouchable. They’re
                        elegant, smart, beautiful, kind…everything we want to be. At 29 years old, my favorite
                        compliment is being told that I look like my mom. Seeing myself in her image, like this daughter
                        up top, makes me so proud of how far I’ve come, and so thankful for where I come from.</p>
                    <h2>Unordered list style?</h2>
                    <p>The refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the eyepiece.

                        The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It uses mirrors to focus the
                        image that you eventually see.

                        Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to give you a good clear image of what
                        you are looking at. You want your telescope to have good collimation so you are not getting a
                        false image of the celestial body.

                        Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But it’s an important word
                        because the aperture of the lens is the key to how powerful your telescope is. Magnification has
                        nothing to do with it, its all in the aperture.

                        Focuser is the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you will look through,
                        in place. The focuser has to be stable and in good repair for you to have an image you can rely
                        on.

                        Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope sits on. The mount is
                        the actual tripod and the wedge is the device that lets you attach the telescope to the mount.
